In this program, what we start with is a DNA string s and what we expect to obtain is a set of possible protein strings that can be translated from ORFs of s while an open reading frame (ORF) is one which starts from the start codon and ends by stop codon.Thus, what is being done string to derive each candidate protein is to translate an open reading frame into amino acids until a stop codon is reached.
